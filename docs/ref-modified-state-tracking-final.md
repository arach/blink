# Modified State Tracking - Final Implementation

**Date:** 2025-07-14  
**Status:** Complete ‚úÖ

## Summary

We've implemented a comprehensive modified state tracking system that:

1. **Tracks which notes have been modified** - Simple flag-based tracking for UI indicators
2. **Stores content hashes** - SHA-256 hashes of note content for change verification
3. **Detects actual changes** - Only saves when content truly differs
4. **Logs prominently** - Uses `log_info!` with üîç emoji when changes are detected

## Key Design Decisions

### Dual-Purpose Architecture
- **Modified flags** - Quick state tracking for the current session
- **Content hashes** - Reliable change detection and future drift detection

### Why Keep Hashing?
The user correctly pointed out that we could track modified state simply since "we are the editor". However, keeping the hashing provides:
- Protection against saving unchanged content
- Infrastructure for detecting external file changes
- Foundation for future sync/conflict resolution features

### Current Behavior
- Computes and compares hashes on every update
- Logs prominently when changes are detected
- Does NOT take action on external changes (just logs)
- Ready for future enhancement when needed

## Implementation Details

### Module: `modified_state_tracker.rs`
```rust
pub struct ModifiedStateTracker {
    dirty_flags: Arc<Mutex<HashMap<String, bool>>>,     // Quick modified state
    content_hashes: Arc<Mutex<HashMap<String, String>>>, // SHA-256 hashes
}
```

### Key Methods
- `has_content_changed()` - Compares new content hash with stored
- `mark_modified()` - Sets the modified flag for a note
- `is_modified()` - Checks if a note has unsaved changes
- `update_content_hash()` - Updates stored hash after save

### Integration Points
- `create_note` - Initializes tracking for new notes
- `update_note` - Checks for actual changes before saving
- `delete_note` - Cleans up tracking data
- App startup - Initializes tracking for all loaded notes

## What This Enables

### Immediate Benefits
- Only saves notes that actually changed
- Reduces disk I/O significantly
- Accurate save status indicators

### Future Possibilities
- External change detection (when files are edited outside Blink)
- Conflict resolution UI
- Sync status indicators
- Undo/redo based on content states

## Logging Example
When content changes are detected:
```
[MODIFIED_STATE] üîç Content change detected for note abc123: old_hash=a1b2c3d4, new_hash=e5f6g7h8
```

## Next Steps (When Needed)
1. Add file system watcher to detect external changes
2. Implement UI indicators for modified state
3. Add conflict resolution when external changes detected
4. Performance metrics to measure save time improvements

The infrastructure is in place - we can enhance it gradually based on user needs.

## 🐛 Bug: Copy doesn't work in vim normal mode
Date: 2025-01-12
Priority: medium
Status: new

Cmd+C (system copy) doesn't work in vim normal mode. The vim yank commands work fine, but the standard OS copy shortcut is not functioning. This is likely because the text selection isn't active in normal mode.
